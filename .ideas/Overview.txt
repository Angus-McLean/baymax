--- High Level Goals ---
Framework :
  - Modules have their own built in routers

  - Standardized stack object
  - Multiple Middleware steps
    - Modules can subscribe/register functions to middlware stages
    - Modules can mark certain middlewares as dependants? (figure out how to order middlewares)
  - Modules can integrate with other modules
    - ie : Make a note a reminder
    ** need to figure out how to do this
  - Can leverage components for interacting with
    - ie "Iteratable" is returned when many search results are found
    - ie "List" used in grocery lists, task lists, assignments, etc

Each Module :
  - Exposes a bot manifest
    - Various properties (title, etc)
    - Registers to middleware stages
    - Handler methods
    - Registers buttons to add to the circle menu
    - Registers bots that it can integrate with?
  - Routing
    - Handles its own routing within its /botModuleName
  - Exposes a card for its object, this way it can be displayed on the Home screen
    - ie : NoteObject would have a card exposed so it can be displayed on the Home screen

Stack :
  - Add options object to ContextStack calls
    - make module invisible to stack page
